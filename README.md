> **EDITH** (Enhanced Digital Intelligence Testing Hub) is a cutting-edge multi-agent system that combines AI planning, execution, and verification to autonomously test Android applications with human-like intelligence.

## 🌟 What is EDITH-QA?

EDITH-QA is a **revolutionary Android UI testing framework** that uses multiple AI agents working together to:

- 🎯 **Plan** complex user workflows using GPT-4
- ⚡ **Execute** actions with Agent-S2's computer vision capabilities  
- ✅ **Verify** results with intelligent keyword matching
- 📊 **Report** comprehensive test results and analytics

Think of it as having a **team of AI specialists** working together to test your Android apps - each agent has a specific role but they collaborate seamlessly to achieve complex testing goals.

### 🤖 The Four-Agent System

| Agent | Role | Technology | What It Does |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|
| **🎯 Supervisor** | Orchestrator | Python | Coordinates the entire testing workflow |
| **📋 Planner** | Strategist | GPT-4 | Breaks down goals into actionable steps |
| **⚡ Executor** | Performer | Agent-S2 + PyAutoGUI | Executes UI actions with computer vision |
| **✅ Verifier** | Validator | Keyword Matching | Confirms task completion and success |

- Success/failure analytics
- Screenshot capture for each step
- Performance metrics and recommendations

## 🎯 Example: Testing "Enable Airplane Mode"

```python
# Input: Simple goal
goal = "Enable Airplane Mode from Settings"

# Output: Complete test execution
{
  "task_prompt": "Enable Airplane Mode from Settings",
  "planner_steps": [
    "1. Unlock the Android device if it's locked.",
    "2. Locate and tap on the 'Apps' icon on the home screen.",
    "3. Scroll through the apps and find the 'Settings' app.",
    "4. Tap on the 'Settings' app to open it.",
    "5. Scroll down the settings menu and find the 'Network & Internet' option.",
    "6. Tap on the 'Network & Internet' option to open it.",
    "7. Find and tap on the 'Airplane Mode' option.",
    "8. Toggle the switch to the 'On' position to enable Airplane Mode.",
    "9. Verify that Airplane Mode is enabled by checking the status bar."
  ],
  "executor_results": ["SUCCESS", "SUCCESS", "SUCCESS", ...],
  "verifier_keywords": ["enable", "airplane", "mode", "settings"],
  "supervisor_result": "✅ Task completed successfully!"
}
```
